      <h2>The problem with email</h2>
      <p>Most people aren’t doing email correctly. There are a number of costly mistakes that both employees and job seekers are making when crafting an email; from failing to greet their recipient to writing inappropriate messages and putting their job on the line. An email is not a text message or Facebook comment thread; the process of composing an effective email requires more thought and consideration on the part of the sender than most other forms of online communication. An effective email is one with a clear purpose that makes it easy for recipients to respond.<br>
        <br>
        By employing certain trade tricks to your writing, your emails should become stronger means of communication, and you will become more adept at decoding incoming messages and have a better understanding of how your messages are interpreted by others.</p>

                <p class="text-block">Email has forever changed our lives, both personally and professionally. Thanks to the internet, email has now become a primary method of communication between people. It has no paper trail, is practically instantaneous and limited only by an internet connection. It is also the primary method of communication used by most businesses and a fast and effective way to communicate with people you don’t see every day.</p>
                <p>Between 2000 and 2014, Australia’s internet usage increased by over 250% according to research by World Internet Users, which indicates just how prevalent information technology is and how it has ingrained itself into our personal and professional lives.</p>

This communication method is so large-scale that email marketers spend thousands of hours each year finding and establishing best practices in order to increase the chances that you open one of the many millions of spam emails sent to Australians every year.

By being clear in your mind, you can start off on the right foot. You can create highly effective emails. If you are not sure about what you need, pick up the phone and make a call. Don’t make ambiguous requests.</p>

        <h3 class="text-green"><strong>Consider your emails as representative of you</strong></h3><br>
          <p>Employees are often consumed with trying to filter through the mass of information sent to them via email. Recognise that when you’re crafting an email, you want to put forward the best version of true yourself. You need to be professional, but as with any face-to-face interaction don’t be afraid to express warmth in your writing. Text on the page can read rather flat if you’re focused on being too formal without considering that you’re really just talking to another human being.<br><br>
          Good communicators know how to use electronic communication to build their persona by being warm and personable, as well as empathetic and accommodating. Phrases like “if you get some time, could you take a look at this?”, or “I would greatly appreciate” or even just a simple “thanks” all express gratitude for the receivers’ time and help them to identify you as someone who is genuine.</p>

                  <strong class="text-pink">Top Tips:</strong> When writing in response to somebody’s email, mirror their approach. How do they usually communicate with you? Do they write two sentences to your four paragraphs? Match their style to achieve a result for your writing effort. Remember, email is meant for simple, quick communication. Say what you want to say, say it quickly, and say it just once.

                  <strong>DO NOT</strong> make your email too “wordy”. Choose your words carefully. Think clear and concise. Always be thinking “what is the aim of the email, what action do you wish the recipient to take?”<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>DO NOT</strong> provide lengthy background information. Attach a file if extra information is required. <br>
